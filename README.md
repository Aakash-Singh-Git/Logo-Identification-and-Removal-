# Logo Identification and Removal

A desktop application for automated identification and removal of logos (e.g. Zoom watermark for Times Network) from images using a YOLO-based detector and multiple AI-powered inpainting backends, with an OpenCV fallback.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **YOLOv8-based Detection**  
  - Real-time logo detection (Nano/Small variant)  
  - Data augmentation pipeline for robust training  

- **Multi-Backend Inpainting**  
  - Stability AI, OpenAI DALLÂ·E 2, Replicate (Stable Diffusion), Hugging Face, ClipDrop  
  - OpenCV Telea algorithm fallback for offline use  

- **User-Friendly GUI**  
  - Built with Python Tkinter  
  - Live preview of detection masks and inpainting results  
  - Configurable AI method selection  

- **Extensible Architecture**  
  - Modular codebase (see `structure.py`, `yolo_model.py`, `data_create.py`, `Logo Remover Main.py`)  
  - Easily retrain on new logos or integrate additional services
